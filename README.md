This is my plymouth script based theme.

You are required to move/copy the theme folder cloned from here via

git clone https://github.com/Bha-Gu/theme

You may also remove the LICENCE and README files before installing.

To install the theme run

sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R theme

Assuming your distro is using/has installed the complete version of plymouth and not the "lite" version.
